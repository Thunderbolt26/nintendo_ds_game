The application consists of a set of three mini-games, with the possibility of setting records, their registration to the network using Wi-fi (because of limited funds, check only on a local network) and have written web pages in php for the processing of incoming queries and the withdrawal of records of all users. The application uses 2D graphics, sprites, interaction with the buttons and the touch screen and also has the ability to search for nearby access points Wi-fi and in compliance with the required standards to send http requests via local network.

It should be noted that the external component of the application ( backgrounds , and other graphics ) almost completely taken out of the game "101 in 1 explosive megamix", however, the internal component of the application has no connection with the original version of the game. On top of that interaction on Wi-fi with computer was not in the original version
